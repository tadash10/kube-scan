optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -d, --dependencies Install dependencies
  -s, --scan         Perform vulnerability scan
  -r, --report       Generate report

To install dependencies, use the -d or --dependencies option:

python vulnerability_scan.py -d

To perform a vulnerability scan, use the -s or --scan option:

python vulnerability_scan.py -s

To generate a report, use the -r or --report option:

python vulnerability_scan.py -r

Alternatively, you can run the script without any arguments to access the main menu:

python vulnerability_scan.py

Additional Security Features

This script also includes several additional security features to enhance its functionality. These features include:

    Password-protected access: Users must enter a password before they can access the vulnerability scanning tool. This prevents unauthorized access to the tool.
    Automated patching: The script automatically patches vulnerabilities as they are discovered. This prevents attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities.
    Two-factor authentication: Users must provide two-factor authentication before they can access the vulnerability scanning tool. This provides an additional layer of security beyond just a password.
    Real-time alerts: The script sends real-time alerts when vulnerabilities are discovered. This allows security teams to respond quickly to potential threats.
    Role-based access control: Access to the vulnerability scanning tool is restricted based on the user's role. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or making changes to the system.
